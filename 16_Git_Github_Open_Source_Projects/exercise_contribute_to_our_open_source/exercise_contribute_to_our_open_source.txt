Exercise: Contribute To Our Open Source

If you haven't done so already, it is time to contribute to your first open-source project!

The contribution can be as big as a new feature, or as small as fixing a typo in the README.md file. Here is what we are going to do:

1. Join our Discord community (see Lecture 2 of this course) and make sure you are in the #group-project channel.

2. Read this 4-step guide by selecting "Open Source Projects"
