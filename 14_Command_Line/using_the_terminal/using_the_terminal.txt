Using The Terminal

A big part of being a developer is being able to use the terminal or the command line.

Well, what is it?
In this lecture, we're going to tackle this question and teach you a couple of very useful commands.

Now on a Mac you simply do command space (CMD-Space) and type in 'Terminal'.
Press 'Enter' and then the terminal will open for you.
It's one of your applications and it's on every computer.

If you're on a Windows machine then it is the Command Prompt
and I'll leave instructions at the end of this lecture on how you can access them
but you might remember this from the Traceroutes video earlier on in the course.

But what is it?
Well, it's how humans originally communicated with computers up until the 1980s.
It was the main way humans gave instructions to computers and computers gave output to humans.
We didn't have something called the GUI or the Graphical User Interface
such as me opening up a new folder and changing the name of this folder or opening up Google Chrome.
I don't really need to know how this is done behind the scenes.
I just click on an icon and it opens it up magically for me.

But command lines are really useful
because you can do the exact same thing that you do visually on a Graphical User Interface like I have here on the command line
but they tend to be much much faster to do as I'm going to show you in this lecture.

And there are also common ways to access different computers around the world,
like if you need to access a server in another country where your web app is hosted.

Well, you'd use the command line and I'll show you how to do that later on in the course.

Now in your day-to-day job, you'll be using the terminal a lot because you'll have to access servers, the database, and your front-end application.
But you can do all of that in one from the terminal.
You can also download scripts that other people have written on the internet so you can use them in your project.

Now these are all things I'm going to show you in the later sections.

The commands that I'm about to show you work on a Mac or Linux.
For Windows, I'll have the Windows version command at the bottom of the lecture
as we progress, most of them are the same but there are a few differences.

So let's get started.

Cmder | Console Emulator
Cmder | Lovely console emulator package for Windows

Using the Cmder console emulator

Command and Description:

FOR MAC OR LINUX:
ls
- lists files and folders within working directory

bash-3.2$ ls

FOR WINDOWS:
dir
- list files

C:\Users\emu
λ dir

I simply type in and press enter and it lists everything that is in my current directory.

What is my current directory?
Well, I do 'pwd' for Present Working Directory
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
pwd
- show current working directory

bash-3.2$ pwd

FOR WINDOWS:
cd {directory name}
- change directory

C:\Users\emu
λ cd
C:\Users\emu

and I see that I'm in the '\Users\{user name}'

If I do 'cd' then I can go into this.
If I wanted to go to, let's say, desktop,
I do 'cd Desktop'.

And now if I do 'ls',
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ cd Desktop
bash-3.2$

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu
λ cd Desktop

C:\Users\emu\Desktop
λ

And now if I do 'ls',
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ ls
untitled folder

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop
λ dir
New folder

I see that I have an 'untitled folder' (FOR WINDOWS: New folder) because that's the only thing on my desktop right now.

I can also do 'cd ..'
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
cd ..
- change working directory to direct parent directory

bash-3.2$ cd ..
bash-3.2$ ls

and this brings me back to one directory up.

FOR WINDOWS:
cd ..
- go up a level

C:\Users\emu\Desktop
λ cd ..

C:\Users\emu
λ dir

I can also do 'clear'
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
clear
- clear current terminal screen

bash-3.2$ clear

to clear up my terminal and have a nice fresh slate.

FOR WINDOWS:
cls
- clear the terminal screen

C:\Users\emu
λ cls

There's a short command 'cd /' and this takes me to the root directory.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
cd /
- change current directory to root directory

bash-3.2$ cd /

If I do 'ls',
bash-3.2$ ls

I see that I have 'Applications, Library, System, Users..'
That's the root directory of my Mac, essentially my Macintosh HD.

FOR WINDOWS:
cd /
- go to root (top) directory

C:\Users\emu
λ cd /

C:\
λ

I can also do 'cd ~'
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
cd ~
- change current directory to user directory

bash-3.2$ cd ~
bash-3.2$ ls

and this takes me to the user directory.

And if we check where we are.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ ls

All right, let's change this 'untitled folder' (FOR WINDOWS: New folder) to something like 'test', okay?

Let's say I'm in the user directory right now, I want to access 'Desktop' and then the 'test' folder.
I would simply do 'cd Desktop/' and then 'test'.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ cd Desktop/test

bash-3.2$ ls
bash-3.2$

And now I'm in the 'test' folder, but there's nothing in there.

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu
λ cd Desktop/test

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ dir

So one thing we can do is I can say 'open .' and it opens a folder that we're currently in.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ open .

Okay, we're in the 'test' folder.

FOR WINDOWS:
start .
- open current directory

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ start .

Now if I just put this to the side over here so you can see, I can say 'mkdir(make directory)', which makes a folder 'name'.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
mkdir name
- create folder called 'name' within current directory

bash-3.2$ mkdir name

So 'name' here will be whatever I want the folder to be titled.

Let's just say this folder would be called 'webapp'.
bash-3.2$ mkdir webapp

Now 'webapp' shows up in my folder.

FOR WINDOWS:
mkdir {file name}
- make a directory

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ mkdir webapp

If I do 'ls' now,
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ ls
webapp

I see that we have the 'webapp' folder

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ dir
webapp

and as we know, we can go into it ('webapp').
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ cd webapp

Let's double-click here to see what we have.
We have absolutely nothing.

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ cd webapp

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ

Well, We can create a file here by saying 'touch' and the name of the file. So let's just do 'index.html'.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
touch index.html
- creates new file titled index.html within working directory

bash-3.2$ touch index.html

There you go, 'index.html'

FOR WINDOWS:
echo > {filename}
- create an empty file

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ echo > index.html

Now what if we wanted to open this 'index.html' again,
we just do 'open' and the '.(dot)' means we open the folder ('webapp') we're currently in which is here.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ open .

But if I do 'open index.html', it opens the file for us. How cool is that?
bash-3.2$ open index.html

FOR WINDOWS:
start {filename}
- open file in default program

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ start index.html

But 'index.html' is pretty empty right now.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could open Sublime Text from here and add something?
Again, you can do that with 'open'.
You put in 'a', so '-a' for application and the name of the application, so "Sublime Text".
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
open -a "Sublime Text"
- opens sublime text program. This syntax can be used to open other programs

bash-3.2$ open -a "Sublime Text"

I have Sublime Text.

Windows ONLY: How to open -a "Sublime Text" in Windows?

**Assuming your Sublime Text 3 was located in the "C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3" directory**

1. In Git Bash copy paste and run:
echo 'alias subl="/C/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/sublime_text.exe"'>>~/.bashrc

2. Close Git Bash and Open it again.

3. In Git Bash type:
subl

Wouldn't it be nice if we could open VS Code from here and add something?
To open Visual Studio Code from the command line (terminal):
FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ code

To open the entire folder/directory:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ code .

But if we wanted to do, '-a (application) Sublime Text' and open the 'index.html' file.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ open -a "Sublime Text" index.html

We just do this.

FOR WINDOWS:
To open the entire folder/directory:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ code .

And now I can say 'html', and it will just say 'Hello, world!'
And if I do 'open index.html',
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ open index.html

We have our 'index.html' file loaded.

Visual Studio Code:
Go Live (Live Server)
Server is Started at port: 5500
Source: Live Server (Extension)

Wasn't that a lot faster than right-clicking, creating a folder, then dragging everything to Visual Studio Code/Sublime Text?
And as you can see, you can do things really really faster.

OK, let's change something.
In the 'webapp', let's say I wanted to change the name of 'index.html' to 'about.html'.
Well, I'll do the 'mv' command, which stands for 'move',
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
mv index.html about.html
- renames index.html file to about.html

but it just moves the 'index.html' file to 'about.html'.

bash-3.2$ mv index.html about.html

So it's a little trick -
You're essentially just moving one file to another but, by changing the name, you create a new file and you replace it with the old one.

So now I have 'about.html'.

FOR WINDOWS:
rename {filename} {new filename}
- rename a file or folder

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ rename index.html about.html

Now these commands typing them can get pretty tiring.
I can press the up arrow and it goes through my entire history, which is very cool.
I can also press the tab key and it will bring up my most recent commands or completes what I'm about to write so you can do it really really fast.
And when your commands get longer and longer it's a very useful thing to do.

I don't really need the 'about.html' file anymore. Let's remove it.
We do 'rm', for 'remove', and the name of the file 'about.html'.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
rm filename
- deletes a file called 'filename' within the current directory

bash-3.2$ rm about.html

It's been removed.

FOR WINDOWS:
del {filename}
- remove a file

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ del about.html

Now, what about the 'webapp' folder, we can remove that as well.
But if I just do 'rm webapp',
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ rm webapp
rm: webapp: No such file or directory

well, it's not going to work.

First of all, if I do 'ls',
bash-3.2$ ls

or 'pwd'(present working directory),
bash-3.2$ pwd
/Users/{user name}/Desktop/test/webapp

I'm in the 'webapp' folder.

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ dir
Directory of C:\Users\{user name}\Desktop\test\webapp

So I need to move back to the 'test' folder.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ cd ..

Now, my 'pwd'(present working directory) is -
bash-3.2$ pwd
/Users/{user name}/Desktop/test

I'm in the 'test' - so I can remove 'webapp' by doing 'rm webapp'.
bash-3.2$ rm webapp
rm: webapp: is a directory

But 'rm' only works for files.
To remove a directory or folder,
rm -r foldername
- used to delete folders. In this case 'foldername' will be deleted

You need to do 'rm' and then use the '-r' option and then the folder name, in our case the 'webapp'.
bash-3.2$ rm -r webapp

There you go, it's gone.

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test\webapp
λ cd ..

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test

rmdir {directory name}
- remove a directory and all files within

C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ rmdir webapp

And with that, you know what, we can remove the 'test' folder as well.
We can go back to our 'Desktop'
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
bash-3.2$ cd ..
bash-3.2$ pwd
/Users/{user name}/Desktop

and then do 'rm -r test'.
bash-3.2$ rm -r test

There you go, it's gone.

FOR WINDOWS:
C:\Users\emu\Desktop\test
λ cd ..

C:\Users\emu\Desktop
λ rmdir test

And one last trick on a Mac.
You can do this.
FOR MAC OR LINUX:
say hello (only on Mac)
- the mac will speak any text you enter after the 'say' keyword

bash-3.2$ say this is so cool

Right?
Very very cool.

As you can see, you can have a lot of power with the terminal.
Eventually, you'll get more and more comfortable with it and things will be much faster than just using the GUI.

In the developer environment section, I'll show you how you can change this boring black-and-white terminal to something like this.
