Contributing To Open Source 2

We've just done our first contribution which wasn't that crazy right?
We just went to the start-here-guidelines (repository) and added our names to the contributor's list
but let's actually contribute to an open-source project now.

Now in our community every month we do coding challenges.
Now you can search for coding challenges here:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery

but this month (October 2019) is a special event because we're actually doing a hacktoberfest (hacktoberfest-2019) event
and this happens once a year in our community in October.
and you can see that if we click on the hacktoberfest-2019 link:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-22
so depending on when you watch this, you might have a different year.

You see that we've provided for you with an opportunity to contribute to an open-source project.
Hacktoberfest 2019
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-22

We actually have Animation Nation (Animation-Nation):
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation

We have a Santafied project:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Santafied

and also a Python project (Python-Art):
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/python-art

and you can contribute to any one of these.

So if we look at Animation Nation (Animation-Nation):
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation

while people have contributed their CSS animations here:
A ZTM Challenge for Hacktoberfest 2019
https://animation-nation.netlify.app/

We also have the Santafied project:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Santafied

A ZTM Challenge for Hacktoberfest 2019
https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/Santafied/

So people have created a little Santa website:
https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/Santafied/

That's kind of nice and very very cool:
https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/Santafied/pages/gifts.html

And then we also have the Python-Art project that actually does something really cool:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/python-art

If I go to the website (folder) here:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/python-art/tree/master/website

the website here will actually turn an image into ASCII art which is really really cool:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvijaycse/python-art/master/website/website.PNG

Now there are tons of projects that you can do but let's try and do this Animation Nation (Animation-Nation) project:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation
https://animation-nation.netlify.app/

So the first thing I'm going to do is go to the project repository:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-22
Project Repo/Instructions:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation

and follow the steps that we've done before
that is we Fork the repository (the button "Fork"):
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation

We now Clone this repository:
~/Desktop
λ git clone https://github.com/aneagoie/Animation-Nation.git

And while that is being cloned let's look at the instructions.
Now most open-source projects will have instructions on how you can contribute.
In our case, we have a nice step-by-step guide (How to contribute).

How to contribute
Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In the Art directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself.

Ok, that's nice and easy to do.

So let's cd into the Animation-Nation project
Shift to project directory:
~/Desktop
λ cd Animation-Nation

~/D/Animation-Nation (master -> origin)
λ

let's open it up in Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
~/D/Animation-Nation (master -> origin)
λ sublime .

or
~/D/Animation-Nation (master -> origin)
λ code .

and we see that there's an Art directory (folder) and in here we have to create our own name or our own folder with our name.
I've actually already created a folder called animatron that has a little CSS project with HTML and CSS.
So just to show you this is my little animation using some simple index.html and CSS. Nothing too crazy:
Source: Live Server (Extension)
http://127.0.0.1:5500/16_Git_Github_Open_Source_Projects/contributing_to_open_source_2/Animation-Nation/Art/animatron/index.html

Now all we need to do is move this into the Art directory (folder) as the instructions have given us
and now we've added our project.
Let's see where is animatron.
There it is.
That's my project (animatron) over there.

2. Within this folder you just made, create two files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.

3. Link your CSS file to your HTML file.

4. Using only HTML and CSS (no <script> allowed!!), create a work of art!
It can be as simple or as complex as you like, as long as it's animated in some way!

So I've actually already done that (create a work of art).

5. Get a screen recording of your finished work, and make a gif! Try to crop it so that it looks good as a smallish (preferably squarish) image.
Save this in your directory, together with your HTML and CSS files. Static screenshots are also acceptable.
If you don't add a gif/screenshot, the website won't show your animation.

Again If we go back to the project I have an index.html file very very simple that's linked to a stylesheet:
index.html

and this is the styles that I've added for my animation:
style.css

for my animation that these little lines:
trance.gif

Now the last part here is to add my own card to this section of the include.js file.

6. Go to the root include.js. You will see an array of objects, each one represents a work of art that someone has created.
Copy an example object and paste it at the end, filling it out with your art information and links:

let cards = [
  //  Add your card in this section
  {
    artName: 'Your art name here',
    pageLink: './Art/Joy/triangle/triangle.html',
    imageLink: './Art/Joy/triangle/triangle.gif',
    author: 'Joy',
    githubLink: 'https://github.com/royranger'
  }
];

So let's just copy this and go to the include.js file.
and you see this is where everybody enters their information.
And we can just add while we copy and paste.
Make sure the indentation is proper.

//  Add your (S. M. Anwarul Islam (Raju)) card in this section
  {
    artName: 'Animatron',
    pageLink: './Art/animatron/index.html',
    imageLink: './Art/animatron/trance.gif',
    author: 'S. M. Anwarul Islam (Raju)',
    githubLink: 'https://github.com/smanwarulislam'
  },

or

//  Add your (Andrei) card in this section
  {
    artName: 'Animatron',
    pageLink: './Art/animatron/index.html',
    imageLink: './Art/animatron/trance.gif',
    author: 'Andrei',
    githubLink: 'https://github.com/aneagoie'
  },

All right.
So that should be good.

Let's now make a pull request.
Now notice here how I did all these changes on the master branch.
~/D/Animation-Nation (master -> origin)
λ

Ideally, we created these changes on a new branch so we can actually just do that now
git checkout -b animatron
~/D/Animation-Nation (master -> origin)
λ git checkout -b animatron
M       include.js
Switched to a new branch 'animatron'

~/D/Animation-Nation (animatron -> origin)
λ

So if I do
git status
~/D/Animation-Nation (animatron -> origin)
λ git status
On branch animatron
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   include.js

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Art/animatron/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Now I see that I have two changes.
That's good.

Let's do
git add
~/D/Animation-Nation (animatron -> origin)
λ git add .

~/D/Animation-Nation (animatron -> origin)
λ git commit -m "adding my artsiness to the project"

And then finally
~/D/Animation-Nation (animatron -> origin)
λ git push origin animatron

All right.

If we go back to the project (repository),
https://github.com/aneagoie/Animation-Nation

we see that we actually now have a little icon that says "Compare & pull request"

If I go back to the forked repo zero-to-mastery
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation

you see right over here that I also have this yellow banner.
So if I click on this green button here "Compare & pull request"
and say
Please add me to this list. @royranger
and we'll link to this (@royranger) is Joy who's one of the managers.
We actually don't even need to tag her (@royranger) because she will check this occasionally.
So I'm going to Create pull request.
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation/pull/173
It's now open.
That's awesome.

Merge pull request #173 from aneagoie/animatron (#173)
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation/pull/173

If I look at my file changes (Files changed) you can see that these are what I've added to the project.
So if I now Merge pull request,
Merging...

Note: Again you won't be able to do this (Merge pull request)
but some of our management team people who are managing the open-source projects will be able to merge for you.

We can delete the branch since we have merged everything.
Delete branch
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation/pull/173

And now let's see if the changes have been made.
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation

If I go to the
https://animation-nation.netlify.app/

So if I now look for my project hey look at that there's my little animatron project that's well here it is:
https://animation-nation.netlify.app/art/animatron/

That's beautiful.
The way this project is designed it randomly selects the CSS animation
so it might not show all of them at the same time so you might have to refresh this a few times.

But just like that I made my open source contribution.

Now there are a ton of projects here that you can join (Zero To Mastery).
And like I said this is a playground for you to test and make mistakes because this isn't a real workplace:
https://github.com/zero-to-mastery

We want to practice these skills before we actually go to work and make big dangerous changes.

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
— Linux

And that's open source.

I highly highly recommend that you get involved.
It's a great way to work with others.
It's a great way to learn how Git and GitHub really work.
There's no doubt that there's a lot that an individual programmer can do.
However, the progress and scale that something can be built is really compounded when many people work on something together.
Go make your first open-source contribution and have fun building things with your fellow programmers.
And may one day lead you to impress a potential employer.
