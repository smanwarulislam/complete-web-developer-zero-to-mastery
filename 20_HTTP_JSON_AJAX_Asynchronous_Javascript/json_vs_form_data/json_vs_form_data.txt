JSON vs Form Data

Originally, the only way to submit some form data to a server was through the <form> tag in HTML.
We have learned that it can do a POST or a GET request.
With JSON you can now grab the contents of the <input> in a form and submit those with JSON instead of as a form data.
You can now submit to the server whenever you want without it necessarily being a <form>, through AJAX...
What is AJAX you might say?
