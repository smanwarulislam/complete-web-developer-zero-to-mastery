Q&A: index.html

Q:
Why index.html?

A:
Google Chrome -> 172.217.7.23 (IP address) -> Google Servers
index.html, about.html, newpage.html -> Google Chrome - A Web Page (https://www.google.com/) - [index.html]

Most of the time there are more than a few HTML file:
index.html
about.html
newpage.html

When we make the request let's say google.com how does the server know which HTML to return first for the homepage?
- By default, most servers just say I will return index.html. index.html is usually thought of that the homepage first HTML file that the server return.
