For WINDOWS Users ONLY

If you are on a Windows Machine (so you can skip this section if your computer is Mac or Linux based),
you will need to install something called Git Bash for you to be able to follow the next lesson.

Here is a detailed guide for you to get set up:

1. Download Git for Windows
https://gitforwindows.org/
Or the Link:
https://git-scm.com/download/win
(we will be using this for future lessons as well so make sure you download it!)

2. Once Git Bash is downloaded, run the downloaded .exe file.
You will get a prompt that says "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?‚Äù Click Yes.

3. Run through the installer:
We will use the default settings for everything in this installation, so all you need to do now is keep clicking Next, and finally Finish.
(If you want more details on what each option does, you can read about it here

and read the Git Bash Windows Installation section)

4. Congratulations! You have just finished the setup.
You can now open "Git Bash" from your computer so you can follow the lesson in the next video.
You now have the same setup as any Mac or Linux user where we call this the "Terminal".

P.S. Windows has recently announced that you will be able to download an actual Terminal from their online store for free.

However, this is still in preview mode so for now, I recommend the above setup.
