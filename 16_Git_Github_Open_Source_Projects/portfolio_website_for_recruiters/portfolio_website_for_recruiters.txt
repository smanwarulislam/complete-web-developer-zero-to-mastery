Portfolio Website for Recruiters

First, we have created a group for students of this course to network on LinkedIn with each other
and endorse each other's skills so recruiters can find your profile and reach out to you for job opportunities.

Second, I have had a lot of recruiters contacting me for remote work developers lately.
In order to connect students who are looking for jobs with these recruiters, I have created a simple website where you can list your information and your portfolio.
This way, I can just forward these requests to this page for recruiters to check you out.
This is completely optional and I hope some students will be able to get jobs this way.

You can check out the website here:

By the way, this is a project that is open-sourced and can be improved upon by the community and you can add your own profile to it.
