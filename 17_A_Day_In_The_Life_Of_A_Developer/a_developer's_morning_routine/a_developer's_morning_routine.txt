A Developer's Morning Routine

Here is my morning routine in order to stay up to date with the industry and make sure that I am on top of the game.
I highly recommend doing something like this throughout your career as well.

P.S. I have a monthly newsletter, Web Developer Monthly,
to summarize everything for you in order to stay up to date with what is happening in our industry every month,
and to make sure you never miss a new resource!

Remember, you shouldn't feel like you MUST DO all of these.
Instead, pick and choose, and take breaks.
Have fun learning and stay up to date with the industry.
This is your career and lifelong learning should be fun!
I use the resources above on a daily to make sure I stay current and I don't miss anything important in the industry.
