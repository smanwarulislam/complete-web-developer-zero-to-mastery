Exercise: Helping A Developer

As a developer, most of the time, you will be working in teams with other developers.
One of the best ways to advance in your career, and also improve your knowledge is to help others debug their code.
Although you may not feel like you know everything yet, you are at a stage now where you can actually help other developers.

Before you move on to the next section you should complete this exercise:

Go to the #helpme channel in our Discord community and try and answer/help somebody who is having difficulty understanding a topic, or with their code.
When you start answering questions and helping debug, you will notice that your skills will exponentially increase as well.
Plus you will get some good karma out of it!
