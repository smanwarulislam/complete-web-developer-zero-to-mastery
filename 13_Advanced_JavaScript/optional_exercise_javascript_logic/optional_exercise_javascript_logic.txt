Optional Exercise: JavaScript Logic

What is the Challenge?

Solve the below 3 javascript puzzles.
- The goal of this challenge is to practice our logic skills.
- Something that is useful not only in interviews when you get challenging problems, but also in your day-to-day work as a developer.
- First, start off by reading this article:

Question 1:
Clean the room function: given an input of [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], make a function that organizes these into an individual array that is ordered.
For example answer(ArrayFromAbove) should return: [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2], 4,5,10,[20,20], 391, 392, 591].
Bonus: Make it so it organizes strings differently from number types. i.e. [1, "2", "3", 2] should return [[1, 2], ["2", "3"]]

Question 2:
Write a javascript function that takes an array of numbers and a target number.
The function should find two different numbers in the array that, when added together, give the target number.
For example: answer([1,2,3], 4) should return [1,3]

Question 3:
Write a function that converts HEX to RGB.
Then Make that function autodetect the formats so that if you enter HEX color format it returns RGB and if you enter RGB color format it returns HEX.
Bonus: Release this tool as an npm package.

The Rules Are:
- Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy, etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge.
- Just like a developer you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging.
- Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own!
