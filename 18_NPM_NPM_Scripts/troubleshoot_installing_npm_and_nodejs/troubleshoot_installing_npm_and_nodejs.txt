Troubleshoot: Installing NPM and Node.js

IMPORTANT:
In this course, we need to be using Node.js version 8.9.1 or higher (Latest LTS Version: 18.17.0), and npm version 5.5.1 or higher (Latest npm 9.6.7)!!!
Latest LTS Version: 18.17.0 (includes npm 9.6.7)

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:
node -v

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:
npm -v

If you get the version number back, everything is working!

If any of these commands result in an error then that (node/npm) doesn't installed on your system.

While using npm or node commands, if you ever get a permission issue, you may need to run the commands with sudo in front of each command.
For more details, review this.

And for Windows: you may have to use another command.

***For Windows Users:***

Wolfgang, one of our fellow students (and master of answering questions in this community)
created a set of videos/lessons for Windows users that you can watch in order to make sure everything that I do on my Mac, also works on Windows.
Scroll down to the very last section of the course titled:
For Windows Users, and check out the Introduction video and the Installing Node.js for Windows video!
