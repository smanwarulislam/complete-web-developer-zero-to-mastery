Quick Note About Redux

This next section is part of my 2nd course The Complete Junior to Senior Developer Roadmap 
where I give you a step-by-step tutorial on how to get out of being a Junior Developer and towards becoming a Senior Developer.
Redux is an advanced topic but also important in this day and age 
especially if you are looking to work as a React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) Developer, so I have decided to add it to this course.

HOWEVER:
I recommend that you skip this part, finish the course, and then return to these videos at the end.
We cover some difficult topics that you would learn more from if you have the foundation from the rest of the sections.
Remember, this course was designed without this section in mind, so think of this as a little bonus for your brain.

With that said, Redux is one of my favorite libraries because it teaches you really really good programming concepts.
Enjoy, and get ready to have your mind blown! :)
