Installing Git

In this section, you will need to have Git installed. But there is some good news!

If you are a Mac user, you already have git installed!

If you are a Windows user and you installed Git for Windows in the last section, you have git installed!

To confirm that you have git, you can simply run this command in your terminal:
git --version

If this responds with a version of git, then you are all set!

Wolfgang, one of our fellow students (and master of answering questions in this community and now the official TA of the course)
created a set of videos for Windows users that you can watch in order to make sure everything that I do on my Mac, also works on Windows.
Scroll down to the very last section of the course titled:
For Windows Users,
and check out the
Introduction video and the
Installing Git for Windows video,
but watch my Git + Github Part 1 and Git + Github Part 2 videos (lectures) first!

*****If you want your command line prompt to show you the git status like in my setup (as you will see in the next video/lecture),
don't worry I will link to this in My Terminal Setup lecture after!*****

Quick notes in case you encounter any errors over the next 2 videos (lectures):

*****If you are getting permission errors when running git commands, you may have to add "sudo" in front of the command like this:
sudo git push
