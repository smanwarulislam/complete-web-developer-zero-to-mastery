You can always change the default branch name on individual repositories.

About the default branch

When you create a repository with content on GitHub.com, GitHub creates the repository with a single branch.
This first branch in the repository is the default branch.
The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository.
The default branch is also the initial branch that Git checks out locally when someone clones the repository.
Unless you specify a different branch, the default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits.

By default, GitHub names the default branch “main” in any new repository.

You can change the default branch for an existing repository. For more information, see "Changing the default branch."
