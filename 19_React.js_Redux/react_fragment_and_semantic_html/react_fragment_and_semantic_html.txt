React.Fragment and Semantic HTML

One thing you will notice with React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is that 
because we always have to return just one element from a component, 
we end up wrapping a lot of our components in <div></div>.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SEMANTIC HTML YOU TAUGHT US ABOUT IN THE HTML SECTION ANDREI!??!!

You are right!
React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) realized this was an issue, 
and with the newer version of React 16.2 (Latest â†’ Stable release: 18.2.0 / 14 June 2022), they introduced something called Fragment to fix this issue.
