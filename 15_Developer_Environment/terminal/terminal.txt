Terminal

In this lecture, we're going to set up our terminal to look nice along with our new set of Sublime Text/VS Code.

As you know the terminal is just a text-based way to communicate with the computer instead of the Graphical User Interface that we normally use.
As developers, you will spend a lot of time with the terminal.
Especially as you become more and more senior in your role.
So let's make it better.

If we open up the terminal - I have it open already for myself, you see that we have the word 'bash' here.
BASH is a type of shell that a terminal can have.
And what do I mean by that?
Just as the name suggests, it's just the casing around the terminal that is customizable.

There's actually more than one shell.
Bash is just one of them.

One of my favorites is 'Oh my ZSH'.
https://ohmyz.sh/

There's the 'fish shell' and they all have different things that you can do with them, but it's just another way to customize your workstation.
https://fishshell.com/

Before I get into that, let's just customize our 'bash'.
The way we do that is we can first start off with getting something other than just having this to the left.
The way we do that is we type in 'nano' which is a text editor and then we do '~/.bash_profile'.
$ nano ~/.bash_profile

And here what we open is a file that is the bash profile. So this is what our profile will look like.
This file gets read every time we open up the terminal.
In here we can put in a bunch of things that we want our terminal to do.

One of the cool things that I really think is fun is updating your 'PS1' variable.
And I'll link to this website.
https://www.maketecheasier.com/8-useful-and-interesting-bash-prompts/

And there are a bunch of examples here that we can use.
Let's just pick one that - like this one over here.
5. Show the Full Directory Path
PS1="[\[\033[32m\]\w]\[\033[0m\]<strong>\n</strong>\[\033[1;36m\]\u\[\033[1;33m\]-> \[\033[0m\]"

All we do is copy and paste this.
And within our bash profile, we can just copy and paste.
And as you can see our PS1 now equals a whole bunch of gibberish that we don't really need to worry about.
We see over here that to exit we need to do Ctrl-X then save modified, we just press 'Y' and then press 'Enter'.
OK, nothing happens but the way we fix that is we now do 'source' and then '~/.bash_profile'.
$ source ~/.bash_profile

It essentially reloads our profile now.
And look at that.
We now have a cool little prompt to the left.

So you can set up your PS1 to display whatever you want.
If you want your current directory to display, that's great.
If you want your username to display, that's good as well.
You can set it up in a ton of ways.

The other thing that the terminal lets you do if you click on something like 'Edit Background Color',
You'll get a few things that you can change in your shell.
You can change your color based on what you want.
And if I bring this (Inspector) over here
you can also click on the 'Profile' and actually it gives you a bunch of pre-built ones that look really cool.
This is 'Pro' actually very nice.

Again you can customize this as well.
And as I mentioned a different operating system, you have your own ways to customize it.
But every single one usually has a profile and a way to modify what gets displayed based on your needs.

Now the one that I really really like, is a shell that's different than bash
and I've used this one (Oh my ZSH) before which is really really good it has a ton of themes that you can use.
They (Oh my ZSH) have a bunch of options and you can play through them.
The one that I really like is the 'fish shell'.
It's very simple.
It has all the operating systems on it and I install it using 'Homebrew' (for macOS or Linux).

Homebrew
Homebrew â€” The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)
https://brew.sh/

For those on a macOS (or Linux), Homebrew is a way to install anything from the web.
So instead of me going to a website and installing something, I can use a command line to download things.

If you go to the Homebrew website, brew.sh,
https://brew.sh/
You can actually just copy this link into your terminal
Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

copy and paste it.
Press enter and it will install homebrew for you.

Note: Homebrew is only supported on macOS and Linux.

The way I install fish -
you can see over here (Go fish) all I have to do is say (for macOS):
brew install fish

And while this is happening, I want to show/mention you another option.
So we have the terminal (Terminal) over here,
But 'iTerm' (or iTerm2) which again is specific for Mac is really really nice and it's way more customizable than the terminal (Terminal).
https://iterm2.com/

So I prefer using 'iTerm2'.
If I open this and double click and look at that. This looks way nicer already.

So let's just compare them side by side.
I have the bash shell here and I have the fish shell here.
Although they both are in the desktop right now they're running on different shells.
The fish shell has - just like we have with the 'bash_profile', has its own profile.
~/Desktop bash_profile

So you can set it up.

And you can set up which one gets activated when you first open up the Terminal or iTerm.
What I recommend is to set up your workstation in a way that's nice to you.
My preferred way is to use iTerm/iTerm2 and the fish shell.
But if you want to use bash that's great.

For iTerm2 and the fish shell:
The beauty here is that if I type in 'bash', I get taken to the bash profile.
~/Desktop bash
bash-3.2$

And if I type in 'fish', I get back to fish.
bash-3.2$ fish
~/Desktop

iTerm2 also lets you just customize everything really nicely.
If I go to Preferences..., you'll see here that I have Appearance, Profiles, where we can have Colors set up.
And there's a ton more you can do with your Terminal.
But I won't get into this lecture because everybody has their own way of doing things.
I just wanted to show you a basic setup, so that now you have a nice environment that you can work in.
