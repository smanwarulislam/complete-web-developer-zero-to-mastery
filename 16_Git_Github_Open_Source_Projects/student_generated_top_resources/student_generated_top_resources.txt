Student Generated Top Resources

Here is a list of the best resources to get you started with learning how to code (mostly related to Web Development).
Feel free to add your favorite resources as well and help others in their journey of learning.
One of the open-source projects started by students is:

https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/resources

https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/resources/

It is a list of great resources as you go through the course and also as you progress through your career as a web developer.
You can visit it if you need extra information, and also contribute your favorite resources to it as well to improve it.

I've also curated my own list of the best resources for developers here:

Hope this helps you along your journey with a little "extra"!
